== 389ds - Directory Server

This deploys the http://directory.fedoraproject.org/[389ds] to the Kubernetes or OpenShift

=== Deploying to kubernetes

To deploy the application to kubernetes using the command from http://fabric8.io/manifests/kubernetes.html and
selecting the version of the dirsrv-389ds app from the list


=== Deploying to OpenShift


IMPORTANT: When deploying in the OpenShift, the project to which the application will be deployed needs to have the
           policy added like  `oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<project>:dirsrv-389ds`

To deploy the application to OpenShift using the command from http://fabric8.io/manifests/openshift.html and
selecting the version of the 389ds app from the list

NOTE: The OpenShift right now allows accessing the LDAP server using NodePort only, as the OpenShift router
needs SNI + other things to do ldap transport
